Homework 3 - Password Generator

by Julian Secomb

Objective: to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It should feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Work done: Created a webpage that generates a random password from an array of alphanumeric characters. Using JavaScript's built in message boxes (prompt and confirm) the user can select various criteria for the password (including length, use of capital and lowercase letters, and use of numbers). If the user enters an invalid response, the program will prompt them to re-enter a value until it receives one within the proper range.

Based on the user's responses, the program generates a password from the appropriate characterset. This password is then printed onto the screen within a text box. The process is initiated by a "generate password" button that is linked to the javscript via an event listener. The password generator is designed to display properly at various device screen sizes.
